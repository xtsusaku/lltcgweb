      "intro_card_member": "**Member cards** are the idols that will perform on Stage. Pay **Energy** equal to their cost to play them from your hand. Each Member has a certain amount of colored **Hearts** (upright) that are used when performing lives. There are also **Blades** (the round penlight icons) and **Blade hearts** (The sideways hearts), but we'll focus on the upright heart for now. Shiki here has **1 purple heart**.",
      "intro_card_live": "**Live cards** are the songs you perform. You can play up to 3 at a time. Lives are cleared using the **Member** cards you've placed on your stage - we'll touch on this more later.",
      "intro_card_energy": "**Energy cards** from your **Energy deck** are placed here. You begin with **3 Energy** and gain **+1** each turn (until all **12** of your energy is in play). Energy is spent to place **Member cards** onto your **stage**.",
      "intro_demo": "I'll walk you through a demo — **Liella!** vs **μ's** on the playmat. You're at the bottom; your opponent is on top.",
      "intro_deck_piles": "The top pile is your **Main Deck**, where you draw cards from. Below is the **Energy deck**.",
      "intro_stage": "The **Stage** (Left / Center / Right) is where Members sit. Their **Heart** colors and **Blade** values fuel Lives during Performance.",
      "intro_live": "**Live Storage** holds up to 3 face-down cards during the Live Phase. You'll be able to see your own cards in this web version, but your opponent's cards will be hidden.",
      "intro_success": "Completing a **live** moves that live card to the **success storage** pile! Keep track of how close you are to winning here!",
      "intro_wr": "The **Waiting Room** is the discard pile.",

      "t1_live_p1": "When you set a **Live** card in the Live phase, it must be attempted later in the same turn, so choose wisely! Liella sets **WE WILL!!** — it needs 1 **red** heart, 1 **purple** heart, and 1 additional heart of **any color** (indicated by a grey heart) to be cleared successfully.",
      "t1_live_p1_lock": "Liella Ends their **Live Phase**, locking in their selection. Unlike the Main Phase, you and your opponent's Live Phase occurs at the same time. If your opponent's Live Phase is not over yet, you'll wait for them to finish before moving on.",

      "t2_start": "**Turn 2** — A card is drawn to your hand, and you gain +1 energy.",
      "t2_skill_intro": "The cards we've played so far only give **hearts** and **blades**, but some cards also have **skills** that affect the game in various ways. Take a look at this card, it features skill text.",
      "t2_skill_preview": "This is an **[On Enter]** skill, meaning when this card enters the stage from your hand, something happens.",
      "t2_play_shiki_skill": "Liella plays Shiki to the right slot. Watch — the game will ask if you want her **On Enter** effect.",
      "t2_on_enter_offer": "If a skill says \"you may\" that means activating it is optional, and you can choose to skip the effect. Liella agrees to **activate** the skill. After paying **1 Energy**, Liella can choose a new card from the top of their deck to add to their hand!",
      "t2_on_enter_confirm": "Now they pick which card to keep. Liella will choose **1 card** to keep, and send the others back to the **Waiting Room**.",
      "t2_on_enter_result": "Shiki's skill resolves — one card joins Liella's hand, two go to the **Waiting Room**. That's an **[On Enter]** skill in action.",
      "t2_end_p1": "Liella ends Main.",
      "t2_main_p2": "μ's plays an affordable Member to add Hearts.",
      "t2_end_p2": "μ's ends Main.",

      "t3_turn": "**Turn 3** — your Main Phase. You drew a card and gained **+1 Energy** (**6** in storage).",
      "t3_baton_intro": "I'll now explain another mechanic called **Baton Pass**. By playing a card over another card already on your Stage, you can **swap** the old card with the new one. When Baton Passing, you're treated as having paid the replaced Member's cost by moving them to the **Waiting Room** — you'll only pay the **difference** in Energy.",
      "t3_baton_example": "**Mei Yoneme** costs **7** — normally **7 Energy** from hand, but Baton Pass over **Shiki** (cost **4**) on **Right** costs only **3** (7−4). **Shiki** stays on **Center** (**2 Blade**), **Mei** on **Right** adds **1 red** and **2 purple** — you'll set **Mirai wa Kaze no You ni** from **hand** in the **Live Phase**, and Stage is one Heart short of clearing it until **Yell**.",
      "t3_baton_play": "Liella **Baton Passes** Mei onto **Right**!",
      "skill_glossary_intro": "You've now seen several skill timings live. Here are common **keywords** you'll see on cards:",
      "skill_on_enter": "**[On Enter]** — fires once when the Member is played from hand onto your Stage (like Shiki just did). Many say *you may* — they're optional.",
      "skill_live_start": "**[Live Start]** — fires when a Live performance with that card begins (like START:DASH). Also often optional.",
      "skill_activated": "**[Activated]** — during your Main Phase, use the buttons under **Activatable skills**. Some Members like **Kinako** can leave Stage to add a **Live** from your **Waiting Room** to your hand.",
      "skill_wr_note": "Some **[Activated]** skills only work while the Member is **in the Waiting Room** — the list shows **WR ·** before their name. Stage skills show the slot instead.",
      "skill_always": "**[Always]** / **[Automatic]** — stays active while conditions are met; no button to press. **Automatic** triggers by itself when something happens.",
      "skill_once": "**[Once per turn]** — even if you could pay the cost again, you only get one use each turn.",
      "skill_center": "**[Center]** — only works if that Member is in the **center** Stage slot.",
      "skill_on_leave": "**[On Leave]** — fires when the Member leaves Stage (Baton Pass, removal effects, etc.).",
      "t3_stage_hearts": "With **Left** open, set **Mirai wa Kaze no You ni** from **hand** in the **Live Phase**. **Shiki** on **Center** and **Mei** on **Right** supply some Hearts — **Mirai wa Kaze no You ni** still needs some more Hearts, which will hopefully be provided by **Yell**. **Mirai wa Kaze no You ni**'s skill allows **Yell** hearts to count as **any** color, so that improves our chances.",
      "t3_end_p1": "Liella ends Main.",
      "t3_live1": "Liella sets **Mirai wa Kaze no You ni** from **hand**.",
